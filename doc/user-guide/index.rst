User guide
====================

This user guide contains all the detailed tutorials about the different parts of CLIMADA.
If you are a new user, we advise you to have a look at the `10 minutes CLIMADA <0_10min_climada>`_
which introduces the basics briefly, or the full `Overview <1_main_climada>`_ which goes more in depth.

You can then go on to more specific tutorial about `Hazard <hazard>`_,
`Exposures <exposures>`_ or `Impact <impact>`_ or advanced usage such as
`Uncertainty Quantification <unsequa>`_
