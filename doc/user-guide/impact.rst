Impact Tutorials
================

These tutorials show how to compute impacts with CLIMADA, and all related aspects such 
as impact functions, adaptation measures and discount rates and cost-benefit analysis.

The first tutorial presents an end-to-end impact calculation, 
and subsequent ones present each aspect in more details.

Additionally you can find a guide on how to populate impact data from EM-DAT database.
