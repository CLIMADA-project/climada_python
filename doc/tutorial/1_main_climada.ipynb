    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CLIMADA?\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA is a fully probabilistic climate risk assessment tool. It provides a framework for users to combine exposure, hazard and vulnerability or impact data to calculate risk. Users can create probabilistic impact data from event sets, look at how climate change affects these impacts, and see how effectively adaptation measures can change them. CLIMADA also allows for studies of individual events, historical event sets and forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a highly customisable, meaning that users can work with out-of-the-box data provided for different hazards, population and economic exposure, or can provide their own data for part or all of the analysis. The pre-packaged data make CLIMADA particularly useful for users who focus on just one element of risk, since CLIMADA can 'fill in the gaps' for hazard, exposure or vulnerability in the rest of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model core is designed to give as much flexibility as possible when describing the elements of risk, meaning that CLIMADA isn't limited to particular hazards, exposure types or impacts. We love to see the model applied to new problems and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA provides classes, methods and data for exposure, hazard and impact functions (also called vulnerability functions), plus a financial model and a framework to analyse adaptation measures. Additional classes and data for common uses, such as economic exposures or tropical storms. Tutorials for every class are available: see the [CLIMADA features](#CLIMADA-features) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### This tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for people new to CLIMADA who want to get a high level understanding of the model and work through an example risk analysis. It will list the current features of the model, and go through a complete CLIMADA analysis to give an idea of how the model works. Other tutorials go into more detail about different model components and individual hazards.\n",

    "# CLIMADA features\n",
    "\n",
    "A risk analysis with CLIMADA can include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the statistical risk to your exposure from a set of events,\n",
    "2. how it changes under climate change, and\n",
    "3. a cost-benefit analysis of adaptation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA is flexible: the \"statistical risk\" above could be describing the annual expected insured flood losses to a property portfolio, the number of people displaced by an ensemble of typhoon forecasts, the annual disruption to a railway network from landslides, or changes to crop yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users from risk-analysis backgrounds will be familiar with describing the impact of events by combining exposure, hazard and an impact function (or vulnerability curve) that combines the two to describe a hazard's effects. A CLIMADA analysis uses the same approach but wraps the exposures and their impact functions into a single `Entity` class, along with discount rates and adaptation options (see the below tutorials for more on CLIMADA's financial model).\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIMADA's `Impact` object is used to analyse events and event sets, whether this is the impact of a single wildfire, or the global economic risk from tropical cyclones in 2100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CLIMADA classes\n",

Several predefined extensions to create particular hazards from particular datasets and models are included with CLIMADA:\n",
    "   - [Tropical cyclone wind](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.html): global hazard sets for tropical cyclone events, constructing statistical wind fields from storm tracks.

    "   - [Crop modelling](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/climada_hazard_entity_Crop.html): combines ISIMIP crop simulations and UN Food and Agrigultre Organization data. The module uses crop production as exposure, with hydrometeorological 'hazard' increasing or decreasing production. \n",

It's is where the Exposures and Impact Functions are stored, which can then be combined with a hazard for a risk analysis (using the Engine's Impact class).

Each exposure is associated with a value (which can be a dollar value, population, crop yield, etc), information to associate it with impact functions for the relevant hazard(s) (in the Entity's ImpactFuncSet), a geometry, and other optional properties such as deductables and cover. Exposures can be loaded from a file, specified by the user, or created from regional economic models accessible within CLIMADA, for example: \n",

CLIMADA provides some common impact functions, or they can be user-specified. The following is an incomplete list:\n",

    "   - [MeasureSet](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/climada_entity_MeasureSet.html): a collection of Measure objects that together describe any adaptation measures being modelled. Adaptation measures are described by their cost, and how they modify exposure, hazard, and impact functions (and have have a method to do these things). Measures also include risk transfer options.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- [**Engine**](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/climada_engine_Impact.html): the CLIMADA Engine contains the Impact and CostBenefit classes, which are where the main model calculations are done, combining Hazard and Entity objects.\n",

The calculations include average annual impact, expected annual impact by exposure item, total impact by event, and (optionally) the impact of each event on each exposure point. Includes statistical and plotting routines for common analysis products.\n",
    "    - [CostBenefit](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/1_main_climada.html#Adaptation-options-appraisal): a class to appraise adaptation options. It uses an Entity's MeasureSet to calculate new Impacts based on their adjustments to hazard, exposure, and impact functions, and returns statistics and plotting routines to express cost-benefit comparisons.\n",
