The hazard looks at the weather forecast from today for an event with two days lead time (meaning the day after tomorrow). generate_WS_forecast_hazard is used to download a current weather forecast for wind gust from opendata.dwd.de. An Impact funtion for building damages due to storms is created. And with only a few lines of code, a LitPop exposure for Switzerland is generated,  and the impact is calculated with a default impact function. With a further line of code, the mean damage per grid point for the day after tomorrow is plotted on a map."
