    "# Calculate probabilistic impact yearset\n",
    "\n",
    "This module generates an `annual_impacts` object which contains probabilistic annual impacts for a specified amount of years (`sampled_years`). The impact values are extracted from a given `event_impact` object that contains impact values per event. The amount of `sampled_years` can be specified as an integer or as a list of years to be sampled for. The amount of events per sampled year (`events_per_year`) are determined with a Poisson distribution centered around n_events per year (n_events = sum(event_impacts.frequency). Then, the probabilistic events occuring in each sampled year (`selected_event`) are sampled uniformaly from the input `event_impacs` object and summed up per year (`impacts_per_year`). Thus, the `annual_impacts` object contains the sum of sampled (event) impacts for each sampled year. In contrast to the expected annual impact (eai), an `annual_impacts` object contains an impact for EACH sampled year and this value differs among years. The selected_events and the number of events_per_year are saved in a sampling dictionary (`sampling_dict`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The function impact_yearsets performs all these computational steps, taking an event_impacts object and the number of sampled_years as input. The output of the function is the annual_impacts object and the sampling_dict.\n",
    "Moreover, a sampling_dict (generated in a previous run) can be provided as optional input and the user can decide whether a correction factor shall be applied (the default is applying the correction factor).\n",
    "Reapplying the same sampling_dict does not only allow to reproduce the generated annual_impacts object, but also for a physically consistent way of sampling impacts caused by different hazards. \n",
    "The correction factor that is applied when the optional input `correction_fac`= True is a scaling of the computed annual_impacts that assures that the eai(annual_events) = eai(events_impacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the process more transparent, this tutorial shows the single computations that are performed when generating an annual_impacts object for a dummy event_impacts object. "
