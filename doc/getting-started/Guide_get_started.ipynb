But if you need a quick introduction or reminder, have a look at the short [Python Tutorial](../getting-started/0_intro_python.ipynb). Also have a look at the python [Python Dos and Don't](../development/Guide_PythonDos-n-Donts.ipynb) guide and at the [Python Performance Guide](../development/Guide_Py_Performance.ipynb) for best practice tips."

The [10 minute climada](../user-guide/0_10min_climada.ipynb) tutorial will give you a quick introduction to CLIMADA, with a brief example on how to calculate you first impacts, as well as your first appraisal of adaptation options, while the [Overview](../user-guide/1_main_climada.ipynb)  will present the whole structure of CLIMADA more in depth. You can then look at the specific tutorials for each module (for example if you are interested in a specific hazard, like [Tropical Cyclones](../user-guide/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb), or in learning to [estimate the value of asset exposure](../user-guide/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb),...).
