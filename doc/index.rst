`CLIMADA <https://climada.ethz.ch>`_ (CLIMate ADAptation) is a free and open-source software framework for
comprehensive climate risk assessment. Designed by a large scientific community,
CLIMADA offers a robust and flexible platform to analyse the impacts of natural
hazards and explore adaptation strategies, and it can be used by researchers,
policy and decision-makers.

CLIMADA is primarily developed and maintained by the `Weather and Climate Risks
Group <https://wcr.ethz.ch/>`_ at `ETH ZÃ¼rich <https://ethz.ch/en.html>`_.

If you use CLIMADA for your own scientific work, please reference the
appropriate publications according to the :doc:`misc/citation`.

This is the documentation of the CLIMADA core module which contains all
functionalities necessary for performing climate risk analysis and appraisal of
adaptation options. Modules for generating different types of hazards and other
specialized applications can be found in the `CLIMADA Petals
<https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ module.
