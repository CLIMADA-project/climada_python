CLIMADA stands for CLIMate ADAptation and is a probabilistic natural catastrophe impact model, that also calculates averted damage (benefit) thanks to adaptation measures of any kind (from grey to green infrastructure, behavioural, etc.).

CLIMADA is primarily developed and maintained by the `Weather and Climate Risks Group <https://wcr.ethz.ch/>`_ at `ETH ZÃ¼rich <https://ethz.ch/en.html>`_.

If you use CLIMADA for your own scientific work, please reference the appropriate publications according to the :doc:`misc/citation`.

This is the documentation of the CLIMADA core module which contains all functionalities necessary for performing climate risk analysis and appraisal of adaptation options. Modules for generating different types of hazards and other specialized applications can be found in the `CLIMADA Petals <https://climada-petals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ module.
