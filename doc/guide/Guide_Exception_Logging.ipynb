    "Exception handling and logging are two important components of programming, in particular for debugging purposes. Detailed technical guides are available online (e.g., [Loggin](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html), [Error and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)). Here we only repeat a few key points and list a few guidelines for CLIMADA."
