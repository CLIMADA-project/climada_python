If it is not already installed, download the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and execute it.\r\n",

Navigate to your ``CLIMADA_python-x.y.z`` repository and open ``doc/tutorial/1_main_CLIMADA.ipynb``. This is the tutorial which will guide you through all CLIMADA's functionalities. Execute each code cell to see the results, you might also edit the code cells before executing. See [tutorials](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/tree/main/doc/tutorial) for more information.\r\n",
