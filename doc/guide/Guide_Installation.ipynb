    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Please execute the instructions of the following text boxes in a Terminal or Anaconda Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the last CLIMADA release available in [CLIMADA releases](https://github.com/climada-project/climada_python/releases) as a zip or tar.gz file. Uncompress it to your local computer. Hereinafter ``climada_python-x.y.z`` refers to the downloaded folder of CLIMADA version x.y.z.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unix, Mac and Windows Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install environment with Anaconda\n",
    "1. **Anaconda**: Download or update to the latest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install dependencies**: In the *Environments* section, use the *Import* box to create a new virtual environment from a yml file. A dialogue box will ask you for the location of the file. Provide first the path of CLIMADA's ``climada_python-x.y.z/requirements/env_climada.yml``. The default name of the environment, *climada_env*, appears. Click the *Import* button to start the installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The installation of the packages will take some minutes. No dialogue box should appear in the meantime. If an error happens, try to solve it looking into the details description. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, set the ``climada_python-x.y.z`` folder path into the environment using the following command::\n",
    "```   \n",
    "      source activate climada_env\n",
    "      conda develop /your/path/to/climada_python-x.y.z/\n",
    "      conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also do so by clicking on the green right arrow in the Anaconda GUI in the *Environments* section right to the 'climada_env' environment, select 'Open Terminal' and execute the following line::\n",
    "```\n",
    "      conda develop /your/path/to/climada_python-x.y.z/\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Test installation**: Before leaving the *Environments* section of Anaconda, make sure that the CLIMADA environment, *climada_env* is selected. Go to the *Home* section of Anaconda and install and launch Spyder (or your preferred editor). Open the file containing all the installation tests, ``tests_install.py`` in ``climada_python-x.y.z`` folder and execute it. If the installation has been successful, an OK will appear at the end (the execution should last less than 2 min).\n",
    "      \n",
    "4. **Run tutorials**: In the *Home* section of Anaconda, with *CLIMADA_env* selected, install and launch *jupyter notebook*. A browser window will show up. Navigate to your ``CLIMADA_python-x.y.z`` repository and open ``doc/tutorial/1_main_CLIMADA.ipynb``. This is the tutorial which will guide you through all CLIMADA's functionalities. Execute each code cell to see the results, you might also edit the code cells before executing. See [tutorials](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/tree/main/doc/tutorial) for more information.\n",

    "----------------------------------\n",
    "1. **Miniconda**: Download or update to the latest version of [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install dependencies**: Create the virtual environment *climada_env* with CLIMADA's dependencies:\n",

    "      conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test installation**: Activate the environment, execute the installation tests and deactivate the environment when finished using CLIMADA::\n",
    "```   \n",
    "    source activate climada_env\n",
