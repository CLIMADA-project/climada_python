In particular, MacOS and `conda install spyder` don't work well together. Although there are cases where `pip install spyder` bears satisfactory results, it is suggested to install `spyder` in a separate Conda environment and run it with the python interpreter from the `climada_env` environment instead. To do so, follow these instructions:\n",
