    "\n",
    "This method is usually used by developers, since it gives you the opportunity to modify the source code and install CLIMADA from any branch of climada_python, including the _develop_ branch where the latest changes are incorporated. If you are not sure whether this is the right option for you or if you are happy with the official CLIMADA releases, you're suggested to pick the method introduced in the section below: Install CLIMADA from PyPI (users). But if you need a particular branch or if you intend to change the code yourself, this is your choice.\n",
