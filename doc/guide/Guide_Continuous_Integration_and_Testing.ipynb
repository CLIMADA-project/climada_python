    "  The main goal of a test is to find bugs _before_ the user encounters them. Ultimately every single line of the program should be subject to test.\\\n",

    "  After the code was executed the _actual_ result is compared to the _expected_ result. The expected result depends on test data, state and parametrization.\\\n",
