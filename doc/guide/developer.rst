Contributing
============

Contributions are very welcome! Please follow these steps:

0. **Install** `Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ and `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ (or `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_).

1. **Fork** the project on GitHub::

    git clone https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python.git

2. **Install the packages** in ``climada_python/requirements/env_climada.yml`` and ``climada_python/requirements/env_developer.yml`` (see :doc:`install`). You might need to install additional environments contained in ``climada_python/requirements`` when using specific functionalities.

3. You might make a new **branch** if you are modifying more than one part or feature::

    git checkout -b feature_branch_name

 `About branches <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches>`_.

4. Write small readable methods, classes and functions. Make well commented and clean **commits** to the repository::

    git pull
    git stats         # use it to see your locally modified files
    git add climada/modified_file.py climada/test/test_modified_file.py
    git commit -m "new functionality of .. implemented"

5. Make unit and integration **tests** on your code, preferably during development:

   * Unit tests are located in the ``test`` folder located in same folder as the corresponding module. Unit tests should test all methods and functions using fake data if necessary. The whole test suit should run in less than 20 sec. They are all executed after each push in `Jenkins <http://ied-wcr-jenkins.ethz.ch/job/climada_ci/>`_.

   * Integration tests are located in ``climada/test/``. They test end-to-end methods and functions. Their execution time can be of minutes. They are executed once a day in `Jenkins <http://ied-wcr-jenkins.ethz.ch/job/climada_ci_night/>`_.

6. Perform a **static code analysis** of your code using ``pylint`` with CLIMADA's configuration ``.pylintrc``. `Jenkins <http://ied-wcr-jenkins.ethz.ch>`_ executes it after every push. To do it locally, you might use the Interface provided by `Spyder`. To do so, search first for `static code analysis` in `View` and then `Panes`.

7. Add new **data dependencies** used in :doc:`data_dependencies` and write a **tutorial** if a new class has been introduced (see :doc:`tutorial`).

8. Add your name to the **AUTHORS** file.

9. **Push** the code or branch to GitHub. To push without a branch (to master) do so::

    git push

 To push to your branch ``feature_branch_name`` do::

    git push origin feature_branch_name

 When the branch is ready, create a new **pull request** from the feature branch. `About pull requests <https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests>`_.


Notes
-----

Update CLIMADA's environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remember to regularly update your code as well as climada's environment. You might use the following commands to update the environments::

    cd climada_python
    git pull
    source activate climada_env
    conda env update --file requirements/env_climada.yml
    conda env update --file requirements/env_developer.yml

If any problem occurs during this process, consider reinstalling everything from scratch following the :doc:install instructions. 
You can find more information about virtual environments with conda `here <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_.
