    "-  Variable names should be chosen to be clear. Avoid\n",
    "   ``item, element, var, list, data`` etc... A good variable name makes\n",
    "   it immediately clear what it contains.\n",
    "-  Avoid as much as possible hard-coded indices for list (no\n",
    "   ``x = l[0], y = l[1]``). Rather, use tuple unpacking (see\n",
    "   [here](https://treyhunner.com/2018/03/tuple-unpacking-improves-python-code-readability/)).\n",
    "   Note that tuple unpacking can also be used to update variables. For\n",
    "   example, the Fibonacci sequence next number pair can be written as\n",
    "   ``n1, n2 = n2, n1+n2``.\n",
    "-  Do not use\n",
    "   [mutable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutable-vs-immutable-objects-in-python/)\n",
    "   (lists, dictionaries, ...) as [default values for functions and\n",
    "   methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132941/least-astonishment-and-the-mutable-default-argument).\n",
    "   Do not write: \n",
    "    ```  \n",
    "    def function(default=[]):\n",

    "-  Make sure the unit tests are testing all the lines of the code. Do not\n",
    "   only check for working cases, but also the most common wrong use\n",
    "   cases.\n",
    "-  Check the docstrings (Do they follow the [Numpydoc conventions](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), is everything clearly explained, are the default\n",
    "   values given and is it clear why they are set to this value)\n",
    "-  Keep the code simple. Avoid using complex Python functionalities whose use\n",
    "   is opaque to non-expert developers unless necessary. For example, the\n",
    "   ``@staticmethod`` decorator should only be used if really \n",
    "   necessary. Another example, for counting the dictionary\n",
