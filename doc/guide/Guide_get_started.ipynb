    "## Installation\n",
    "The first step to getting started is installing CLIMADA. To do so you will need:\n",
    "1. To get the lastest release from the git repository [CLIMADA releases](https://github.com/climada-project/climada_python/releases) or clone the project with git if you are interested in contributing to the development.\n",
    "2. To build a conda environment with the dependencies needed by CLIMADA. \n",

    "For details see the [Installation Instructions](install.rst).\n",

    "If you need to run a model on a computational cluster, have a look at [this guide](Guide_Euler.ipynb) to install CLIMADA and run your jobs."

But if you need a quick introduction or reminder, have a look at the short [Python Tutorial](../tutorial/0_intro_python.ipynb). Also have a look at the python [Python Dos and Don't](../guide/Guide_PythonDos-n-Donts.ipynb) guide and at the [Python Performance Guide](../guide/Guide_Py_Performance.ipynb) for best practice tips."

The [Main Tutorial](../tutorial/1_main_climada.ipynb) will introduce you the structure of CLIMADA and how to calculate you first impacts, as well as your first appraisal of adaptation options. You can then look at the specific tutorials for each module (for example if you are interested in a specific hazard, like [Tropical Cyclones](../tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb), or in learning to [estimate the value of asset exposure](../tutorial/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb),...).

Note that the documentation has several versions: 'latest', 'stable' and explicit version numbers, such as 'v3.1.1', in the url path. 'latest' is created from the 'develop' branch and has the latest changes of the developers, 'stable' from the latest release. For more details about documentation versions, please have a look at [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/climada-python/versions/)."

Before making a new feature, discuss with one of the repository admins (Now Chahan, Emmanuel and David). Every new feature or enhancement should be done on a separate branch, which will be merged in the develop branch after being reviewed (see [Checklist](../guide/Guide_Reviewer_Checklist.ipynb)). Finally, the develop branch is merged in the main branch in each CLIMADA release. Each new feature should come with a tutorial and with [Unit and Integration Tests](../guide/Guide_Continuous_Integration_and_Testing.ipynb). "
