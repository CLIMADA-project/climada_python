    "Jenkins has a GUI for monitoring individual tests, full test runs and test result trends.\\\n",
    "Developers are requested to watch it. At first when they push commits to the code repository, but also later on, when other changes in data or sources may make it necessary to review and refactor code that once passed all tests.\n",

    "- All tests must pass before submitting a pull request.\n",

    "In the summary of all tasks you will find the \"Artifacts\" with coverage reports provided as ZIP files.\n",
    "You can download these files, unzip them, and open the resulting HTML files in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developer guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the coverage of novel code is at 100% before submitting a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that having a code coverage alone does not grant that all required tests have been written!\\\n",

    "### Unit Testing Guideline\n",
    "This pipeline is defined by the ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` file.\n",
    "It contains a single job which will create a CLIMADA environment with Mamba for multiple Python versions, install CLIMADA, run the unit tests, and report the test coverage as well as the simplified test results.\n",
    "The job has a [strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy) which runs it for multiple times for different Python versions.\n",
    "This way, we make sure that CLIMADA is compatible with all currently supported versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coverage reports in HTML format will be uploaded as job artifacts and can be downloaded as ZIP files.\n",
    "The test results are simple testing summaries that will appear as individual checks/jobs after the respective job completed."
