    """Create an annual_impacts object containing a probabilistic impact for each year
      in the sampled_years list (or for a list of sampled_years generated with the length
                                 of given sampled_years)
      by sampling events from the existing input event_impacts with a Poisson distribution
      centered around n_events per year (n_events = sum(event_impacts.frequency)).
      In contrast to the expected annual impact (eai) annual_impacts contains impact values that
      differ among years (the correction factor can however be used to scale the annual_impacts
                          to fit the eai of the events_impacts object that is used to generated it)

    Parameters:
      event_impacts : impact object
          impact object containing impacts per event
    Optional parameters:
        sampled_years : int or list
            Either an integer specifying the number of years to
            be sampled (labelled [0001,...,sampled_years]) or a list
            of years that shall be covered by the resulting annual_impacts.
            The default is a 1000 year-long list starting in the year 0001.
        sampling_dict : dict
            The sampling dictionary specifying how to sample the annual_impacts
            It consists of two arrays:
                selected_events: array
                    indices of sampled events in event_impacts.at_event()
                events_per_year: array
                    number of events per sampled year
            The sampling_dict needs to be obtained in a first call,
            i.e. [annual_impacts, sampling_dict] = climada_yearsets.impact_yearset(...)
            and can then be provided in subsequent calls(s) to obtain the exact same sampling
            (also for a different event_impacts object)
        correction_fac : boolean
            If True a correction factor is applied to the resulting annual_impacts. They are
            scaled in such a way that the expected annual impact (eai) of the annual_impacts
            equals the eai of the events_impacts

    Returns:
      annual_impacts : impact object
          annual impacts for all sampled_years
      sampling_dict : dict
          the sampling dictionary containing two arrays:
