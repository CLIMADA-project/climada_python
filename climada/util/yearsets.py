                                 of given sampled_years)
      by sampling events from the existing input event_impacts with a Poisson distribution
      centered around n_events per year (n_events = sum(event_impacts.frequency)).

    Parameters:
      event_impacts : impact object
          impact object containing impacts per event
    Optional parameters:
        sampled_years : int or list
            Either an integer specifying the amount of years to
            be sampled or a list of years that shall be covered by the resulting annual_impacts
            default: a 1000 year-long list starting in the year 0001
        sampling_vect : dict
            The sampling vector specifying which events contained in the events_impacts are
            selected in the newly created annual_impacts and the number of events per year
            in the annual_impacts, therefore the sampling_vect contains two arrays:
                selected_events (array): sampled events (len: total amount of sampled events)
                events_per_year (array): events per sampled year
            The sampling_vector needs to be obtained in a first call,
            i.e. [annual_impacts, sampling_vect] = climada_yearsets.impact_yearset(...)
            and can then be provided in subsequent calls(s) to obtain the exact same sampling
            (also for a different event_impacts object)
        correction_fac : boolean
            If True the resulting annual_impacts are scaled in so that the expected annual
            impact (eai) of the annual_impacts = eai of the events_impacts

    Returns:
      annual_impacts : impact object
          annual impacts for all sampled_years
      sampling_vect : dict
          the sampling vector containing two arrays:

              events_per_year (array) : events per sampled year
