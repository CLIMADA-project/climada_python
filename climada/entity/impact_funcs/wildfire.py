        As 295K resembles the lowest number of a FIRMS data set, i_thresh can
        be set constant to 295 K leaving i_half the only parameter that needs
        calibration. i_half is set to 523.8 as a result of the calibration
        performed by Lüthi (2021).

        Calibration has been performed globally (using EMDAT data) on a 10 km
        resolution. Thus, function is optimised to estimate impacts on 10 km.

        Intensity range is set between 295 K and 500 K as this is the typical
        range of FIRMS intensities.

        Parameters:
            i_half (float, optional): steepnes of the IF, [K] at which 50% of
