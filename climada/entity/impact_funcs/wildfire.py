        """ This function sets the impact curve to a sigmoid type shape, as
        common in impact modelling. We adapted the function as proposed by
        Emanuele (2011) which hinges on two parameters (intercept (i_thresh)
        and steepness (i_half) of the sigmoid).

        .. math::
            i_n = \frac{MAX[(I_{lat, lon}-I_{thresh}), 0]}{I_{half}-I_{thresh}}

        The intercept is defined at the minimum intensity of a FIRMS value
        (295K) which leaves the steepness (i_half) the only parameter that
        needs to be calibrated.

        Here, i_half is set to 523.8 as a result of the calibration
        performed by LÃ¼thi et al. (in prep).

        Calibration has been performed globally (using EMDAT data) on a 10 km
        resolution. Thus, function is optimised to estimate impacts on 10 km.

        Intensity range is set between 295 K and 500 K as this is the typical
        range of FIRMS intensities.

        Parameters:
            i_half (float, optional): steepnes of the IF, [K] at which 50% of
            max. damage is expected
