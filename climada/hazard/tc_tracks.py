        """Create new TCTracks object from IBTrACS databse.

        When using data from IBTrACS, make sure to be familiar with the scope and limitations of
        IBTrACS, e.g. by reading the official documentation
        (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/pdf/IBTrACS_version4_Technical_Details.pdf). Reading the
        CLIMADA documentation can't replace a thorough understanding of the underlying data. This
        function only provides a (hopefully useful) interface for the data input, but cannot
        provide any guidance or make recommendations about if and how to use IBTrACS data for your
        particular project.

        Resulting tracks are required to have both pressure and wind speed information at all time
        steps. Therefore, all track positions where one of wind speed or pressure are missing are
        discarded unless one of `interpolate_missing` or `estimate_missing` are active.

        Some corrections are automatically applied, such as: `environmental_pressure` is enforced
        to be larger than `central_pressure`.

        Note that the tracks returned by this function might contain irregular time steps since
        that is often the case for the original IBTrACS records: many agencies add an additional
        time step at landfall. Apply the `equal_timestep` function afterwards to enforce regular
        time steps.

        Parameters
        ----------
        provider : str or list of str, optional
            Either specify an agency, such as "usa", "newdelhi", "bom", "cma", "tokyo", or the
            special values "official" and "official_3h":

            * "official" means using the (usually 6-hourly) officially reported values of the
              officially responsible agencies.
            * "official_3h" means to include (inofficial) 3-hourly data of the officially
              responsible agencies (whenever available).

            If you want to restrict to the officially reported values by the officially responsible
            agencies (`provider="official"`) without any modifications to the original official
            data, make sure to also set `estimate_missing=False` and `interpolate_missing=False`.
            Otherwise, gaps in the official reporting will be filled using interpolation and/or
            statistical estimation procedures (see below).
            If a list is given, the following logic is applied: For each storm, the variables that
            are not reported by the first agency for this storm are taken from the next agency in
            the list that did report this variable for this storm. For different storms, the same
            variable might be taken from different agencies.
            Default: ``['official_3h', 'usa', 'tokyo', 'newdelhi', 'reunion', 'bom', 'nadi',
            'wellington', 'cma', 'hko', 'ds824', 'td9636', 'td9635', 'neumann', 'mlc']``
        rescale_windspeeds : bool, optional
            If True, all wind speeds are linearly rescaled to 1-minute sustained winds.
            Note however that the IBTrACS documentation (Section 5.2,
            https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/pdf/IBTrACS_version4_Technical_Details.pdf) includes
            a warning about this kind of conversion: "While a multiplicative factor can describe
            the numerical differences, there are procedural and observational differences between
            agencies that can change through time, which confounds the simple multiplicative
            factor." Default: True
        storm_id : str or list of str, optional
            IBTrACS ID of the storm, e.g. 1988234N13299, [1988234N13299, 1989260N11316].
        year_range : tuple (min_year, max_year), optional
            Year range to filter track selection. Default: None.
        basin : str, optional
            If given, select storms that have at least one position in the specified basin. This
            allows analysis of a given basin, but also means that basin-specific track sets should
            not be combined across basins since some storms will be in more than one set. If you
            would like to select storms by their (unique) genesis basin instead, use the parameter
            `genesis_basin`. For possible values (basin abbreviations), see the parameter
            `genesis_basin`. If None, this filter is not applied. Default: None.
        genesis_basin : str, optional
            The basin where a TC is formed is not defined in IBTrACS. However, this filter option
            allows to restrict to storms whose first valid eye position is in the specified basin,
            which simulates the genesis location. Note that the resulting genesis basin of a
            particular track may depend on the selected `provider` and on `estimate_missing`
            because only the first *valid* eye position is considered. Possible values are 'NA'
            (North Atlantic), 'SA' (South Atlantic), 'EP' (Eastern North Pacific, which includes
            the Central Pacific region), 'WP' (Western North Pacific), 'SP' (South Pacific),
            'SI' (South Indian), 'NI' (North Indian). If None, this filter is not applied.
            Default: None.
        interpolate_missing : bool, optional
            If True, interpolate temporal reporting gaps within a variable (such as pressure, wind
            speed, or radius) linearly if possible. Temporal interpolation is with respect to the
            time steps defined in IBTrACS for a particular storm. No new time steps are added that
            are not originally defined in IBTrACS.
            For each time step with a missing value, this procedure is only able to fill in that
            value if there are other time steps before and after this time step for which values
            have been reported.
            This procedure will be applied before the statistical estimations referred to
            by `estimate_missing`. It is applied to all variables (eye position, wind speed,
            environmental and central pressure, storm radius and radius of maximum winds).
            Default: True
        estimate_missing : bool, optional
            For each fixed time step, estimate missing pressure, wind speed and radius using other
            variables that are available at that time step.
            The relationships between the variables are purely statistical. In comparison to
            `interpolate_missing`, this procedure is able to estimate values for variables that
            haven't been reported by any agency at any time step, as long as other variables are
            available.
            A typical example are storms before 1950, for which there are often no reported values
            for pressure, but for wind speed. In this case, a rough statistical pressure-wind
            relationship is applied to estimate the missing pressure values from the available
            wind-speed values.
            Make sure to set `rescale_windspeeds=True` when using this option because the
            statistical relationships are calibrated using rescaled wind speeds.
            Default: False
        correct_pres : bool, optional
            For backwards compatibility, alias for `estimate_missing`.
            This is deprecated, use `estimate_missing` instead!
        discard_single_points : bool, optional
            Whether to discard tracks that consists of a single point. Recommended for full
            compatiblity with other functions such as `equal_timesteps`. Default: True.
        file_name : str, optional
            Name of NetCDF file to be dowloaded or located at climada/data/system.
            Default: 'IBTrACS.ALL.v04r00.nc'

            linked above.
        years : list of int, optional
            If given, only read the specified "years" from the txt-File. Note that a "year" refers
            to one ensemble of tracks in the data set that represents one sample year.

        Returns
        -------
        tracks : TCTracks
            TCTracks with data from the STORM simulations.

        Notes
        -----
        All tracks are set in the year 1980. The id of the year (starting from 0) is saved in the
        attribute 'id_no'. To obtain the year of each track use

        >>> years = [int(tr.attrs['id_no'] / 1000) for tr in tc_tracks.data]
        >>> # or, alternatively,
        >>> years = [int(tr.attrs['sid'].split("-")[-2]) for tr in tc_tracks.data]

        If a windfield is generated from these tracks using the method ``TropCylcone.from_tracks()``,
        the following should be considered:

        1. The frequencies will be set to ``1`` for each storm. Thus, in order to compute annual
           values, the frequencies of the TropCylone should be changed to ``1/number of years``.
        2. The storm year and the storm id are stored in the ``TropCyclone.event_name`` attribute.
