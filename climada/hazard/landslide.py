        """
        Set probabilistic annual landslide hazard (fraction, intensity and
        frequency) for a defined bounding box from a raster.
        The hazard data for which this function is explicitly written
        is readily provided by UNEP & the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute
        (NGI), and can be downloaded and unzipped from
        https://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=landslides&evcat=2&lang=eng
        for precipitation-triggered landslide and from
        https://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=landslides&evcat=1&lang=eng
        for earthquake-triggered landslides.
        It works of course with any similar raster file.
        Original data is given in expected annual probability and percentage
        of pixel of occurrence of a potentially destructive landslide event
        x 1000000 (so be sure to adjust this by dividing through 1m afterwards).
        More details can be found in the landslide tutorial and under above-
        mentioned links.

        The hazard is set such that intensity takes a binary value (0 - no
        ls occurrence probability; 1 - ls occurrence probabilty >0) and
        fraction stores the actual probability * fraction of affected pixel.
        Frequency is 1 everywhere, since the data represents annual occurrence
        probability.

        Impact functions, since they act on the intensity, should hence be in
        the form of a step function,
        defining impact for intensity 0 and (close to) 1.

        Parameters:
        ----------
