# CLIMADA

CLIMADA stands for **CLIM**ate **ADA**ptation and is a probabilistic natural catastrophe impact model, that also calculates averted damage (benefit) thanks to adaptation measures of any kind (from grey to green infrastructure, behavioural, etc.).

CLIMADA is divided into two parts: 
1. the core [climada_python](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) contains all the modules necessary for the probabilistic impact, the averted damage, uncertainty and forecast calculations. Data for hazard, exposures and impact functions can be obtained from the API. Litpop is included as demo Exposures module, and Tropical cyclones is included as a demo Hazard module. 
2. the petals [climada_petals](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_petals) contains all the modules for generating data (e.g., TC_Surge, WildFire, OpenStreeMap, ...). Most development is done here. The petals builds-upon the core and does not work as a stand-alone.

It is recommend for new users to begin with the core (1).

This is the Python (3.8+) version of CLIMADA - please see https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada for backward compatibility (MATLAB).

## Getting started

CLIMADA runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/releases). Install CLIMADA's dependencies specified in  the downloaded file `climada_python-x.y.z/requirements/env_climada.yml` with conda. See the documentation for more [information on installing](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/Guide_Installation.html).

Follow the [tutorial](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/tutorial.html) `climada_python-x.y.z/doc/tutorial/1_main_climada.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook to see what can be done with CLIMADA and how.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on Read the Docs:

* [online (recommended)](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [PDF file](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/climada-python/latest/climada-python.pdf)

## Contributing

To contribute follow these steps:

1. Fork the project on GitHub.
2. Create a local clone of the develop branch (`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/climada_python.git -b develop`)
3. Install the packages in `climada_python/requirements/env_climada.yml` and `climada_python/requirements/env_developer.yml`.
4. Make well commented and clean commits to your repository.
5. Make unit and integration tests on your code, preferably during development.
6. Perform a static code analysis of your code with CLIMADA's configuration `.pylintrc`.
7. Add your name to the AUTHORS file.
8. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push origin develop`).
9. On GitHub, create a new pull request onto the develop branch of CLIMADA-project/climada_python.
