# CLIMADA

CLIMADA stands for **CLIM**ate **ADA**ptation and is a probabilistic natural catastrophe impact model, that also calculates averted damage (benefit) thanks to adaptation measures of any kind (from grey to green infrastructure, behavioural, etc.).

This is the Python (3.8+) version of CLIMADA - please see https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada for backward compatibility (MATLAB).

## Getting started

CLIMADA runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/releases). Install CLIMADA's dependencies specified in  the downloaded file `climada_python-x.y.z/requirements/env_climada.yml` with conda. See the documentation for more [information on installing](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html).

Follow the [tutorial](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/tutorial.html) `climada_python-x.y.z/doc/tutorial/1_main_climada.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook to see what can be done with CLIMADA and how.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on Read the Docs:

* [online (recommended)](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [PDF file](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/climada-python/latest/climada-python.pdf)
