# CLIMADA

CLIMADA stands for **CLIM**ate **ADA**ptation and is a probabilistic natural catastrophe impact model, that also calculates averted damage (benefit) thanks to adaptation measures of any kind (from grey to green infrastructure, behavioural, etc.).

As of today, CLIMADA provides global coverage of major climate-related extreme-weather hazards at high resolution via a [data API](https://climada.ethz.ch/data-api/v1/docs), namely (i) tropical cyclones, (ii) river flood, (iii) agro drought and (iv) European winter storms, all at 4km spatial resolution - wildfire to be added soon. For all hazards, historic and probabilistic event sets exist, for some also under select climate forcing scenarios (RCPs) at distinct time horizons (e.g. 2040). See also [papers](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_papers) for details.

CLIMADA is divided into two parts (two repositories): 
1. the core [climada_python](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) contains all the modules necessary for the probabilistic impact, the averted damage, uncertainty and forecast calculations. Data for hazard, exposures and impact functions can be obtained from the [data API](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_util_api_client.ipynb). [Litpop](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb) is included as demo Exposures module, and [Tropical cyclones](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb) is included as a demo Hazard module. 
2. the petals [climada_petals](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_petals) contains all the modules for generating data (e.g., TC_Surge, WildFire, OpenStreeMap, ...). Most development is done here. The petals builds-upon the core and does not work as a stand-alone.

It is recommend for new users to begin with the core (1) and the [tutorials](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/tree/main/doc/tutorial) therein.

This is the Python (3.8+) version of CLIMADA - please see https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada for backward compatibility (MATLAB).

## Getting started

CLIMADA runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It can be installed from sources or - in case of climada_python - directly with pip. See the [installation guide](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/Guide_Installation.html) for instructions.

Follow the [tutorial](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/1_main_climada.html) `climada_python-x.y.z/doc/tutorial/1_main_climada.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook to see what can be done with CLIMADA and how.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on Read the Docs:

* [online (recommended)](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [PDF file](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/stable/pdf/)

## Contributing

To contribute follow these steps:

1. Fork the project on GitHub.
2. Create a local clone of the develop branch (`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/climada_python.git -b develop`)
3. Install the packages in `climada_python/requirements/env_climada.yml` and `climada_python/requirements/env_developer.yml`.
4. Make well commented and clean commits to your repository.
5. Make unit and integration tests on your code, preferably during development.
6. Perform a static code analysis of your code with CLIMADA's configuration `.pylintrc`.
7. Add your name to the AUTHORS file.
8. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push origin develop`).
9. On GitHub, create a new pull request onto the develop branch of CLIMADA-project/climada_python.
